        Panic attacks are intense, frightening experiences that can make you feel like you're dying or losing control. The good news: panic is highly treatable, and online therapy provides effective, accessible support. This guide explains what panic attacks are, how treatment works, and where to find help.

      <h2>What Is a Panic Attack?</h2>
      <p>
        A panic attack is a sudden surge of intense fear or discomfort that peaks within minutes. Common symptoms include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Physical symptoms:</strong> Racing or pounding heart, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, chills or hot flashes, numbness or tingling</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive symptoms:</strong> Fear of losing control, fear of dying, feeling detached from yourself (derealization/depersonalization)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Panic attacks typically last 5-20 minutes but can feel much longer. They're terrifying but not physically dangerous—your body is activating its fight-or-flight response inappropriately.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Panic Attacks vs. Panic Disorder</h2>
      <p>
        Many people experience one or two panic attacks in their lifetime. Panic disorder is diagnosed when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recurrent, unexpected panic attacks</li>
        <li>Persistent worry about having more attacks (at least one month)</li>
        <li>Significant changes in behavior to avoid attacks (e.g., avoiding certain places)</li>
        <li>Symptoms aren't caused by substances or another medical condition</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Only a licensed mental health professional can diagnose panic disorder.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Why Seek Help?</h2>
      <p>
        Untreated panic can lead to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Agoraphobia:</strong> Avoiding places where escape might be difficult during a panic attack</li>
        <li><strong>Social isolation:</strong> Withdrawing from activities and relationships</li>
        <li><strong>Anticipatory anxiety:</strong> Constant fear of the next attack</li>
        <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Often develops alongside chronic panic</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced quality of life:</strong> Panic dictating where you go and what you do</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The great news: panic disorder responds very well to treatment. Most people see significant improvement.

      <h2>Evidence-Based Treatments for Panic</h2>

      <h3>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h3>
      <p>
        The gold-standard treatment for panic disorder. CBT helps you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand the panic cycle and how thoughts fuel symptoms</li>
        <li>Challenge catastrophic interpretations of bodily sensations</li>
        <li>Learn that panic sensations, while uncomfortable, aren't dangerous</li>
        <li>Gradually face avoided situations (exposure therapy)</li>
        <li>Develop coping skills for managing symptoms</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Interoceptive Exposure</h3>
      <p>
        A specific technique where you deliberately induce panic-like sensations (spinning, hyperventilating) in a controlled way to reduce fear of the sensations themselves.
      </p>

      <h3>Medication</h3>
      <p>
        Several medication types can help:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SSRIs/SNRIs:</strong> First-line medications that reduce panic frequency over time</li>
        <li><strong>Benzodiazepines:</strong> Fast-acting but typically short-term due to dependency risk</li>
        <li><strong>Beta-blockers:</strong> Can reduce physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many people benefit most from combining medication with therapy.

      <h2>Coping During a Panic Attack</h2>
      <p>
        These techniques can help when panic strikes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Remind yourself:</strong> "This is a panic attack. It's uncomfortable but not dangerous. It will pass."</li>
        <li><strong>Slow your breathing:</strong> Breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, out for 6-8. Focus on extending the exhale.</li>
        <li><strong>Ground yourself:</strong> Use the 5-4-3-2-1 technique—name 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you can touch, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay present:</strong> Focus on concrete details around you rather than "what if" thoughts.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't fight it:</strong> Resisting panic often intensifies it. Ride the wave and let it pass.</li>
        <li><strong>Move gently:</strong> Walking slowly or gentle stretching can help discharge adrenaline.</li>
      </ul>
