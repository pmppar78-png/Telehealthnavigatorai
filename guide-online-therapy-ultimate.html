      <h2>What Is Online Therapy?</h2>
      <p>
        Online therapy, also known as e-therapy, teletherapy, or virtual therapy, is the delivery of mental health services through digital platforms. Instead of meeting a therapist in a traditional office setting, you connect through:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Video sessions:</strong> Live face-to-face conversations through a webcam, similar to video calls</li>
        <li><strong>Phone sessions:</strong> Voice-only calls with your therapist</li>
        <li><strong>Text messaging:</strong> Asynchronous communication where you send messages and receive responses</li>
        <li><strong>Live chat:</strong> Real-time text-based conversations</li>
        <li><strong>Combination approaches:</strong> Many platforms offer a mix of these communication methods</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Online therapy is provided by licensed mental health professionals, including psychologists, licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs), licensed professional counselors (LPCs), and licensed marriage and family therapists (LMFTs).
      </p>

      <h2>Is Online Therapy Effective?</h2>
      <p>
        Research has shown that online therapy can be as effective as in-person therapy for many conditions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple studies show equivalent outcomes for depression and anxiety treatment</li>
        <li>Client satisfaction rates are comparable to in-person therapy</li>
        <li>Therapeutic alliance (the relationship between therapist and client) can develop effectively online</li>
        <li>Some clients prefer online therapy and show better engagement</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The effectiveness of therapy depends significantly on the individual, the therapeutic relationship, and the specific concerns being addressed—not just the delivery method.

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
      <p>
        Reputable online therapy platforms take privacy seriously:

        <li>Secure servers store your information</li>
        <li>You control what information is shared</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, you should also take steps to protect your privacy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use private, secure internet connections</li>
        <li>Find a private space for sessions</li>
        <li>Keep your login credentials secure</li>
        <li>Log out after each session</li>
      </ul>
