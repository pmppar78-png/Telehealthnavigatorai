      <h2>Understanding Couples Therapy</h2>
      <p>
        Couples therapy, also called marriage counseling or relationship counseling, helps partners:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Improve communication:</strong> Learn to express needs and listen effectively</li>
        <li><strong>Resolve conflicts:</strong> Develop healthier ways to handle disagreements</li>
        <li><strong>Rebuild trust:</strong> Work through betrayal, infidelity, or broken promises</li>
        <li><strong>Navigate transitions:</strong> Adjust to major life changes together</li>
        <li><strong>Reconnect emotionally:</strong> Address distance or disconnection</li>
        <li><strong>Strengthen the relationship:</strong> Build a stronger foundation</li>
        <li><strong>Make decisions:</strong> Work through difficult decisions including whether to stay together</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Couples therapy works best when both partners are willing to participate and engage in the process.
