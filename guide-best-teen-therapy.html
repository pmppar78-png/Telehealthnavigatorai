      <h2>Why Teens May Prefer Online Therapy</h2>
      <p>
        Online therapy may appeal to teenagers for several reasons:

        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Can attend sessions without peers seeing them at a therapist's office</li>
        <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> May feel more at ease in their own space</li>
        <li><strong>Digital familiarity:</strong> Teens are often comfortable with digital communication</li>
        <li><strong>Text-based options:</strong> Messaging may feel less intimidating than face-to-face talking</li>
        <li><strong>Scheduling flexibility:</strong> Easier to fit around school and activities</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced barriers:</strong> No transportation needed; parents don't need to take time off work</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Parents Should Know</h2>

      <h3>Consent and Involvement</h3>
      <p>
        For minors, parental or guardian consent is required for therapy. However, the extent of ongoing parental involvement varies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Parents typically receive general updates on progress</li>
        <li>The content of therapy sessions is usually confidential to encourage teen openness</li>
        <li>Therapists will break confidentiality if there's a safety concern (required by law)</li>
        <li>Parents should discuss expectations about privacy and communication upfront</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Balancing Privacy and Safety</h3>
      <p>
        Teens need some privacy to build trust with their therapist, but parents also need to ensure safety:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Discuss with the therapist what information will be shared with you</li>
        <li>Understand that therapists are mandated reporters for safety concerns</li>
        <li>Create an environment where your teen feels comfortable telling you important things</li>
        <li>Respect the therapeutic relationship while staying appropriately involved</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Practical Considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Private space:</strong> Ensure your teen has a private place for sessions</li>
        <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Good internet connection and appropriate device</li>
        <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Help coordinate appointments with school and activities</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Encourage regular attendance</li>
      </ul>
