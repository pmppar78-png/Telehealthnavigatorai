    <section class="legal-section">
      <p class="hero-text">Schizophrenia is a serious mental health condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and perceives reality. While it requires comprehensive professional care, telehealth can play a supportive role in ongoing management, medication monitoring, and connecting with mental health services. This guide provides educational information about schizophrenia and how virtual care options may fit into a broader treatment plan.</p>

      <h2>Understanding Schizophrenia</h2>
      <p>Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide. It typically emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood and involves disruptions in thought processes, perceptions, emotional responsiveness, and social interactions.</p>
      <p>Common symptoms may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Positive symptoms:</strong> Hallucinations (hearing or seeing things others don't), delusions (fixed false beliefs), disorganized thinking and speech</li>
        <li><strong>Negative symptoms:</strong> Reduced emotional expression, decreased motivation, social withdrawal, difficulty experiencing pleasure</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive symptoms:</strong> Difficulties with attention, memory, and executive functioning</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Only qualified mental health professionals can diagnose schizophrenia through comprehensive evaluation. Early intervention and consistent treatment lead to better outcomes.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Treatment Approaches</h2>
      <p>Schizophrenia is typically managed with a combination of approaches:</p>

      <h3>Medication</h3>
      <p>Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone of schizophrenia treatment. They help manage symptoms and reduce the risk of relapse. Finding the right medication and dosage often requires careful monitoring and adjustment by a psychiatrist.</p>

      <h3>Psychotherapy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> Helps identify and change unhelpful thought patterns</li>
        <li><strong>Social skills training:</strong> Builds communication and interaction abilities</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive remediation:</strong> Addresses cognitive difficulties</li>
        <li><strong>Family therapy:</strong> Educates and supports family members</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Psychosocial Support</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Supported employment and education programs</li>
        <li>Case management and care coordination</li>
        <li>Peer support groups</li>
        <li>Housing assistance</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>How Telehealth Can Support Schizophrenia Care</h2>
      <p>While schizophrenia often requires in-person care, especially during initial diagnosis and acute episodes, telehealth can complement treatment in several ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Medication management:</strong> Regular check-ins with psychiatrists to monitor medication effectiveness and side effects</li>
        <li><strong>Therapy sessions:</strong> Ongoing psychotherapy when stable</li>
        <li><strong>Family education:</strong> Virtual sessions for family members to learn about the condition</li>
        <li><strong>Care coordination:</strong> Communication between treatment team members</li>
        <li><strong>Crisis prevention:</strong> Early intervention when warning signs appear</li>
        <li><strong>Reducing barriers:</strong> Overcoming transportation and mobility challenges</li>
      </ul>
