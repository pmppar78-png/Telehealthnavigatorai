      <h2>Medicare Telehealth Coverage Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Medicare now covers a wide range of telehealth services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mental health services:</strong> Therapy, counseling, and psychiatry</li>
        <li><strong>Medical visits:</strong> Primary care and specialist consultations</li>

        <li><strong>Multiple modalities:</strong> Video and, in many cases, audio-only visits</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The COVID-19 pandemic led to major expansions in Medicare telehealth, and many of these changes have been extended or made permanent by Congress.
