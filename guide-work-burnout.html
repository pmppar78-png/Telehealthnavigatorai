        Burnout is more than feeling tired after a long week—it's a state of chronic workplace stress that leads to exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced effectiveness. Telehealth provides accessible support for recognizing, addressing, and recovering from burnout without adding to your already overwhelming schedule.
      </p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Understanding Burnout</h2>
      <p>
        The World Health Organization recognizes burnout as an occupational phenomenon characterized by three dimensions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exhaustion:</strong> Feeling depleted of energy, emotionally and physically drained</li>
        <li><strong>Cynicism/Detachment:</strong> Increased mental distance from your job, negative or indifferent feelings about work</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced efficacy:</strong> Feeling less competent and productive, doubting your abilities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Burnout develops gradually and can be difficult to recognize when you're in the middle of it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Signs of Burnout</h2>

        <li>Sleep disturbances—insomnia or excessive sleep</li>
        <li>Headaches, muscle tension, or other physical complaints</li>
        <li>Changes in appetite</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Emotional Signs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Feeling helpless, trapped, or defeated</li>
        <li>Detachment and isolation</li>
        <li>Increasingly cynical or negative outlook</li>

      <h2>Burnout vs. Depression vs. Stress</h2>
      <p>
        These conditions can overlap but have distinct features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stress:</strong> Characterized by overengagement—too much, but still caring. Recovery happens when stressors reduce.</li>
        <li><strong>Burnout:</strong> Characterized by disengagement—feeling empty, beyond caring. Primarily work-related. Recovery requires addressing workplace factors.</li>
        <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Pervasive across all areas of life, not just work. May include hopelessness, worthlessness, and thoughts of self-harm.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Chronic burnout can lead to depression. A mental health professional can help distinguish between them.
      </p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Causes of Burnout</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Workload:</strong> Unrealistic demands, impossible deadlines, insufficient resources</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of control:</strong> No input into decisions, micromanagement, rigid policies</li>
        <li><strong>Insufficient reward:</strong> Inadequate pay, lack of recognition, no advancement</li>
        <li><strong>Toxic community:</strong> Workplace conflict, bullying, lack of support</li>
        <li><strong>Unfairness:</strong> Bias, favoritism, unequal treatment</li>
        <li><strong>Values mismatch:</strong> Work conflicts with personal ethics or priorities</li>
        <li><strong>Poor work-life balance:</strong> Work encroaching on personal time and relationships</li>
      </ul>

        While working with a professional, these strategies support burnout recovery:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Set boundaries:</strong> Protect personal time, limit after-hours work communication</li>
        <li><strong>Prioritize ruthlessly:</strong> Not everything is urgent; learn to say no</li>
        <li><strong>Take breaks:</strong> Short breaks throughout the day, regular vacations</li>
        <li><strong>Reconnect with meaning:</strong> Remember why you chose this work, or explore new directions</li>
        <li><strong>Care for basics:</strong> Sleep, nutrition, movement, social connection</li>
        <li><strong>Pursue interests outside work:</strong> Hobbies, relationships, activities that restore you</li>
        <li><strong>Address workplace issues:</strong> Talk to management, consider job changes if needed</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>When Burnout Requires Major Changes</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes individual coping strategies aren't enough. Consider bigger changes if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The workplace culture is toxic and unlikely to change</li>
        <li>Your values fundamentally conflict with your job</li>
        <li>You've tried addressing issues with no improvement</li>
        <li>Your health is seriously suffering</li>
        <li>You've lost all connection to why you do this work</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A therapist or coach can help you navigate career transitions and major decisions.
