      <h2>Understanding International Telehealth Challenges</h2>

      <h3>Licensing and Legal Issues</h3>
      <p>
        Mental health professionals are typically licensed by jurisdiction:

        <li>Some countries have restrictions on receiving telehealth from foreign providers</li>

        <li><strong>Internet connectivity:</strong> Variable quality in different locations</li>

      <h2>Options for International Telehealth</h2>

      <h3>Option 1: Continue with US-Based Providers</h3>
      <p>
        Some US providers may continue seeing you while you're abroad:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Discuss your plans with your current provider</li>
        <li>Some therapists will see existing clients internationally</li>
        <li>Licensing rules vary—providers must decide their comfort level</li>
        <li>Plan for time zone differences</li>
        <li>Understand limitations (no crisis services, no prescriptions abroad)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Option 2: US Platforms with International Service</h3>
      <p>
        Some US telehealth platforms serve people outside the US:

      <p>
        Note: Psychiatric services and prescriptions typically cannot be provided internationally by US providers.
      </p>

      <h3>Option 3: International Telehealth Platforms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Expatriate-focused services:</strong> Some platforms specifically serve expat communities</li>
        <li><strong>Country-specific platforms:</strong> Many countries have their own telehealth services</li>
        <li><strong>International employee assistance programs:</strong> If your employer offers global EAP</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Option 4: Local Providers in Your Host Country</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Many countries have English-speaking mental health professionals</li>
        <li>Local providers understand the cultural context</li>
        <li>May be more affordable depending on location</li>
        <li>Can provide in-person care if needed</li>
