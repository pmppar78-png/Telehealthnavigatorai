      <h2>Important Limitations of Free Options</h2>
      <p>
        While free and low-cost options can be valuable, understand their limitations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Peer support is not therapy:</strong> Volunteer listeners cannot diagnose, treat, or provide clinical guidance</li>
        <li><strong>Not for emergencies:</strong> If you're in crisis, contact crisis resources or emergency services</li>
        <li><strong>Quality varies:</strong> Free services may have less consistency than paid professional care</li>
        <li><strong>Waitlists:</strong> Low-cost options often have longer wait times</li>
        <li><strong>Limited specialization:</strong> May not have expertise in specific conditions</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>When to Seek Professional Help</h2>
      <p>
        Free peer support is helpful for many situations, but consider professional help if you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have thoughts of harming yourself or others</li>
        <li>Are experiencing severe symptoms that interfere with daily life</li>
        <li>Need medication evaluation or management</li>
        <li>Have been diagnosed with or suspect a mental health condition</li>
        <li>Are dealing with trauma or abuse</li>
        <li>Have not improved with self-help approaches</li>
