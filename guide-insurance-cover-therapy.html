    <h1>Does Insurance Cover Online Therapy?</h1>
    <p class="legal-date">Comprehensive educational resource – not financial or legal advice</p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <p class="hero-text">
        Good news: most health insurance plans now cover online therapy the same way they cover in-person visits. This guide explains how insurance coverage works for telehealth mental health services and helps you find in-network providers to minimize your out-of-pocket costs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Insurance Coverage for Online Therapy: The Basics</h2>
      <p>
        Since the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth coverage has expanded dramatically. Most major insurance plans now cover virtual mental health services, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Individual therapy sessions via video</li>
        <li>Psychiatry appointments for medication management</li>
        <li>Group therapy sessions</li>
        <li>Couples and family therapy (varies by plan)</li>
        <li>Psychological testing and assessments (some plans)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mental Health Parity Laws</h3>
      <p>
        Federal law (the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act) requires most insurance plans to cover mental health services at the same level as physical health services. This means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Similar copays for mental health and medical visits</li>
        <li>Similar deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums</li>
        <li>No unreasonable limits on therapy sessions</li>
        <li>Access to an adequate provider network</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Finding In-Network Online Therapists</h2>
      <p>
        Using in-network providers typically results in the lowest out-of-pocket costs. These platforms specialize in connecting you with therapists who accept your specific insurance:

      <h2>What You'll Pay With Insurance</h2>
      <p>
        Your actual costs depend on your specific insurance plan:
      </p>

      <h3>Common Cost Structures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Copay:</strong> A fixed amount per visit (typically $20-$50 for in-network)</li>
        <li><strong>Coinsurance:</strong> A percentage of the visit cost (e.g., 20% after deductible)</li>
        <li><strong>Deductible:</strong> Amount you pay before insurance kicks in</li>
        <li><strong>Out-of-pocket maximum:</strong> Annual limit on your total costs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>In-Network vs. Out-of-Network</h3>
      <table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;">
        <tr style="background: var(--gray-100);">
          <th style="padding: 0.75rem; text-align: left; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-300);">Factor</th>

      <h2>Popular Subscription Platforms and Insurance</h2>
      <p>

      <h2>Steps to Verify Your Coverage</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Find your insurance card</strong> – You'll need your member ID, group number, and the customer service phone number.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Call the mental health number</strong> – Many cards have a separate number for behavioral health services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ask specific questions:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Does my plan cover telehealth therapy?</li>
            <li>What is my copay for outpatient mental health visits?</li>
            <li>Is there a separate deductible for mental health services?</li>
            <li>Are there session limits per year?</li>
            <li>Do I need pre-authorization for therapy?</li>
            <li>Which telehealth platforms are in-network?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use online tools</strong> – Many platforms like <a href="https://www.headway.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Headway</a> and <a href="https://www.rula.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Rula</a> can verify your benefits instantly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Get it in writing</strong> – Request a Summary of Benefits document for mental health services.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What If You Have Out-of-Network Benefits?</h2>
      <p>
        If your preferred therapist doesn't accept your insurance, you may still get partial reimbursement:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Pay your therapist directly for each session</li>
        <li>Request a "superbill" (detailed receipt with diagnosis codes)</li>
        <li>Submit the superbill to your insurance for reimbursement</li>
        <li>Receive reimbursement based on your out-of-network benefits</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Services like <a href="https://www.reimbursify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reimbursify</a> can help streamline the out-of-network claims process.
