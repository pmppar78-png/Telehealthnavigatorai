        A smooth telehealth experience depends on reliable technology. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need—from internet requirements and device setup to troubleshooting common problems—so you can focus on your health, not technical issues.
      </p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Internet Connection Requirements</h2>

      <h3>Minimum Speeds for Video Calls</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic video call:</strong> 1.5 Mbps download and upload</li>
        <li><strong>HD video call:</strong> 3-4 Mbps download and upload</li>
        <li><strong>Recommended for reliability:</strong> 10+ Mbps to handle fluctuations</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Test Your Internet Speed</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Visit a speed test website (speedtest.net is commonly used)</li>
        <li>Click "Go" or "Start" to begin the test</li>
        <li>Note both download and upload speeds</li>
        <li>Test at the time you'll typically have appointments</li>
        <li>Test from the location where you'll take calls</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Improving Your Connection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use ethernet when possible:</strong> Wired connections are more stable than WiFi</li>
        <li><strong>Move closer to your router:</strong> WiFi signal weakens with distance and walls</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce competing traffic:</strong> Pause downloads, streaming on other devices</li>
        <li><strong>Restart your router:</strong> This can resolve many connection issues</li>
        <li><strong>Consider a WiFi extender:</strong> If your router is far from your therapy space</li>
        <li><strong>Upgrade your plan:</strong> If speeds are consistently too slow</li>
      </ul>

        <li>More portable than computers</li>
        <li>Larger screen than phones</li>
        <li>Use a stand to keep it stable and at eye level</li>
