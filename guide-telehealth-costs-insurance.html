    <section class="legal-section">
      <p class="hero-text">
        Understanding the cost of telehealth services and how insurance coverage works can help you make informed decisions about your care. This guide breaks down pricing models, insurance considerations, and options for finding affordable telehealth services.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Telehealth Pricing Models</h2>
      <p>
        Telehealth services use various pricing structures:
      </p>

      <h3>Subscription-Based Pricing</h3>
      <p>
        A weekly or monthly fee that typically includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scheduled video or phone sessions (usually weekly)</li>
        <li>Unlimited or substantial messaging with your provider</li>
        <li>Access to platform resources and tools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Examples: <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">BetterHelp</a> ($60-$100/week), <a href="https://www.talkspace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Talkspace</a> ($69-$109/week), <a href="https://www.cerebral.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Cerebral</a> ($85-$325/month)
      </p>

      <h3>Per-Session Pricing</h3>
      <p>
        Pay for each individual session:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Therapy sessions: typically $80-$200+</li>
        <li>Psychiatry sessions: typically $150-$350+ for initial, $100-$200 for follow-ups</li>
        <li>Primary care visits: typically $50-$100</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This model is common with insurance-based platforms like <a href="https://www.headway.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Headway</a>, <a href="https://www.growtherapy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Grow Therapy</a>, and <a href="https://www.rula.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Rula</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Membership Models</h3>
      <p>
        A monthly membership fee plus reduced per-visit costs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lower individual visit costs than pay-per-session</li>
        <li>Often includes additional benefits (messaging, resources)</li>
        <li>Good for ongoing care needs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Cash-Pay/Direct Pay</h3>
      <p>
        Transparent pricing without insurance involvement:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.sesamecare.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Sesame</a> offers transparent cash pricing for various services</li>
        <li>Often competitive with insurance copays</li>
        <li>No insurance paperwork or restrictions</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
