      <h2>Before Your First Session</h2>
      <p>
        Most online therapy platforms will have you complete several steps before your first appointment:
      </p>

      <h3>Intake Questionnaires</h3>
      <p>
        You'll typically fill out forms covering:

        <li>Reason for seeking therapy</li>

        <li>Past therapy experiences</li>
        <li>Emergency contact information</li>
        <li>Safety screening questions</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Insurance and Payment Setup</h3>
      <p>
        Whether using platforms like <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">BetterHelp</a> or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Talkspace</a>, or insurance-based services like <a href="https://www.headway.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Headway</a>, you'll need to provide payment information or verify insurance coverage before your session.
      </p>

      <h3>Technology Check</h3>
      <p>
        Test your setup beforehand:
      </p>

        <li>Ensure your camera and microphone work</li>
        <li>Check your internet connection stability</li>
        <li>Download any required apps or software</li>
        <li>Know how to log in and access the session</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Happens During the First Session</h2>

      <h3>The Introduction (First 5-10 Minutes)</h3>
      <p>
        Your therapist will likely start by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introducing themselves and their background</li>
        <li>Explaining confidentiality and its limits</li>
        <li>Reviewing informed consent</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Getting to Know You (Main Portion)</h3>
      <p>
        The therapist will gather information about you, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What brought you to therapy:</strong> Your current concerns and challenges</li>
        <li><strong>Your history:</strong> Relevant background, past treatment, family history</li>

        <li><strong>Your daily life:</strong> Work, relationships, support systems</li>
        <li><strong>Your strengths:</strong> Coping skills and resources you already have</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Assessment and Planning</h3>
      <p>
        Near the end, your therapist may:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Share initial observations</li>
        <li>Discuss potential treatment approaches</li>
        <li>Set preliminary goals together</li>

      <h2>Tips for a Successful First Session</h2>

      <h2>After Your First Session</h2>
      <p>
        It's normal to have mixed feelings after your first therapy session. You might feel:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Relief:</strong> Finally taking action on your mental health</li>
        <li><strong>Emotionally drained:</strong> Discussing difficult topics takes energy</li>
        <li><strong>Hopeful:</strong> Seeing a path forward</li>
        <li><strong>Uncertain:</strong> Wondering if this therapist or approach is right for you</li>
        <li><strong>Impatient:</strong> Wanting faster progress</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Give yourself time to process the experience. Consider journaling about what came up and any questions for next time.

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>What If the First Session Doesn't Feel Right?</h2>
      <p>
        Not every therapist-client match is perfect. Consider these factors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Give it a few sessions:</strong> It can take 2-3 sessions to get comfortable</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate concerns:</strong> Let your therapist know if something isn't working</li>
        <li><strong>Trust your instincts:</strong> If you feel truly uncomfortable, it's okay to try someone else</li>
        <li><strong>Most platforms allow switching:</strong> Services like <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">BetterHelp</a> and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Talkspace</a> make it easy to switch therapists</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Finding the right fit is important—don't give up on therapy if the first match isn't ideal.

      <h2>Special Considerations for Online Sessions</h2>
      <p>
        Online therapy has unique aspects to keep in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical issues:</strong> Have a backup plan (phone number) if video fails</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Ensure no one can overhear your session</li>
        <li><strong>Body language:</strong> Position your camera so your therapist can see your face and upper body</li>
        <li><strong>Eye contact:</strong> Looking at the camera (not the screen) creates better connection</li>
        <li><strong>Distractions:</strong> Close other apps and silence notifications</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Session Length and Frequency</h2>
      <p>
        First sessions are typically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 45-60 minutes (sometimes longer for intake)</li>
        <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Weekly sessions are most common initially</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing communication:</strong> Some platforms like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Talkspace</a> offer messaging between sessions</li>
