      <h2>How to Find Your Workplace Benefits</h2>

      <h3>Where to Look</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Benefits portal:</strong> Your employer's online benefits system</li>
        <li><strong>Employee handbook:</strong> Often outlines available resources</li>
        <li><strong>HR department:</strong> Can explain your options</li>
        <li><strong>Benefits orientation materials:</strong> From when you started</li>
        <li><strong>Open enrollment documents:</strong> Annual benefits information</li>
        <li><strong>Intranet:</strong> Company internal resources page</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Questions to Ask HR</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Do we have an EAP? How do I access it?</li>
        <li>Do we offer any additional mental health benefits or platforms?</li>
        <li>How many therapy sessions are covered?</li>
        <li>Are family members eligible?</li>
        <li>Is telehealth available?</li>
        <li>What's the cost to me (if any)?</li>
        <li>Is there coaching available in addition to therapy?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Note: You don't need to explain why you're asking. Simply asking about benefits is normal and doesn't raise concerns.

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Confidentiality and Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding privacy protections is important for feeling comfortable using workplace mental health benefits:
      </p>

      <h3>What's Protected</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>EAPs are confidential:</strong> Your employer typically only knows aggregate usage data, not individual names</li>
        <li><strong>HIPAA protection:</strong> Mental health records are protected health information</li>
        <li><strong>Separate from employment:</strong> Using services doesn't affect your job status</li>
        <li><strong>Therapy content:</strong> What you discuss in sessions is confidential</li>
        <li><strong>Mental health platforms:</strong> Lyra, Spring Health, Modern Health all have strong privacy protections</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Exceptions to Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>
        As with any therapy, confidentiality may be broken if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>There's risk of harm to yourself or others</li>
        <li>Abuse of a child, elder, or vulnerable adult is suspected</li>
        <li>Court order requires disclosure</li>
        <li>You provide written consent for disclosure</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Protecting Your Privacy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact EAP or mental health platform directly, not through work systems</li>
        <li>Use personal devices if you prefer</li>
        <li>Schedule sessions outside work hours if you want complete separation</li>
        <li>Your manager doesn't need to know why you're requesting time off</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">

    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
