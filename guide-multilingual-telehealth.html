      <h2>Interpreter Services</h2>
      <p>
        If you can't find a therapist who speaks your language, interpreter services are an option:
      </p>

      <h3>How Interpreter-Assisted Therapy Works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A trained medical interpreter joins your telehealth session</li>
        <li>They translate between you and the therapist in real-time</li>
        <li>Interpreters are bound by confidentiality</li>
        <li>Can be done via phone (audio) or video</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Accessing Interpreter Services</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ask your healthcare provider:</strong> Many are required to provide interpreter services</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance coverage:</strong> Many plans cover interpreter services</li>
        <li><strong>Community health centers:</strong> Often have interpreter access</li>
        <li><strong>Federally Qualified Health Centers:</strong> Required to provide language access</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Considerations for Interpreted Sessions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sessions may take longer due to translation</li>
        <li>Some nuance may be lost in translation</li>
        <li>Request a mental health-trained interpreter when possible</li>
        <li>Having a third person present may feel less private</li>
        <li>Still beneficial when native-language providers aren't available</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Cultural Competence Beyond Language</h2>
      <p>
        Language is important, but cultural understanding matters too:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shared background:</strong> Therapists from your culture may understand unique stressors</li>
        <li><strong>Immigration experience:</strong> Understanding of adjustment, documentation stress, family separation</li>
        <li><strong>Acculturation:</strong> Navigating between cultures</li>
        <li><strong>Family dynamics:</strong> Understanding cultural expectations around family</li>
        <li><strong>Stigma:</strong> Awareness of mental health stigma in different communities</li>
        <li><strong>Religious/spiritual integration:</strong> Respecting the role of faith and tradition</li>
        <li><strong>Historical context:</strong> Understanding historical trauma and community experiences</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Questions to Ask Potential Therapists</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Are you a native speaker or did you learn the language?</li>
        <li>What experience do you have working with people from my cultural background?</li>
        <li>How do you approach cultural differences in therapy?</li>
        <li>Are you familiar with [specific cultural concept or challenge]?</li>
        <li>How do you handle sessions when there are cultural misunderstandings?</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Benefits of Telehealth for Multilingual Access</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Geographic freedom:</strong> Connect with providers anywhere, not just locally</li>
        <li><strong>More options:</strong> Larger pool of language-matching therapists</li>
        <li><strong>Time zone flexibility:</strong> Work with providers in different regions</li>
        <li><strong>Community connection:</strong> Find therapists who share your specific background</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Access care without community members seeing you</li>
        <li><strong>Family sessions:</strong> Include family members in different locations</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Overcoming Common Barriers</h2>

      <h3>Limited Provider Availability</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Be flexible with scheduling—popular providers may have waitlists</li>
        <li>Consider providers in different time zones</li>
        <li>Try multiple platforms and directories</li>
        <li>Consider interpreter services as an alternative</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Cost Concerns</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Check if your insurance covers out-of-area providers via telehealth</li>
        <li>Ask about sliding scale fees</li>
        <li>Community health centers may have bilingual providers</li>
        <li>Some nonprofit organizations offer free or low-cost bilingual services</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technology Challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Many platforms work on smartphones—no computer needed</li>
        <li>Phone (audio-only) sessions are an option</li>
        <li>Family members can help with technical setup</li>
        <li>Libraries and community centers may provide technology access</li>
      </ul>
