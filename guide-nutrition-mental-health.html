      <p class="hero-text">
        What you eat affects how you feel. The emerging field of nutritional psychiatry reveals clear connections between diet and mental health. While food isn't a cure for mental illness, nutrition is an often-overlooked factor in mental wellness. This guide explores the science and offers practical strategies for eating to support your mental health.

      <h2>The Gut-Brain Connection</h2>
      <p>
        Your gut and brain are deeply connected:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The vagus nerve:</strong> Direct communication highway between gut and brain</li>
        <li><strong>Gut microbiome:</strong> Trillions of bacteria that influence mood and brain function</li>
        <li><strong>Neurotransmitter production:</strong> About 95% of serotonin is made in the gut</li>
        <li><strong>Inflammation:</strong> Gut health affects body-wide inflammation, which impacts the brain</li>
        <li><strong>Immune system:</strong> 70% of immune cells reside in the gut, affecting overall health</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is why digestive issues often accompany anxiety and depression, and why diet affects mental health.

      <h2>When Mental Health Affects Eating</h2>
      <p>
        Mental health challenges often disrupt eating:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Loss of appetite or emotional eating; low motivation to cook</li>
        <li><strong>Anxiety:</strong> Appetite changes, digestive issues, stress eating</li>
        <li><strong>Eating disorders:</strong> Complex relationship with food requiring specialized treatment</li>
        <li><strong>Medication effects:</strong> Some medications affect appetite and weight</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you're struggling to eat well due to mental health symptoms, focus on getting adequate nutrition rather than perfection, and consider professional support.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Professional Support</h2>
      <p>
        Consider working with professionals for personalized guidance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Registered Dietitian:</strong> Especially those trained in mental health nutrition</li>
        <li><strong>Primary care provider:</strong> Can test for nutritional deficiencies</li>
        <li><strong>Therapist:</strong> For emotional eating, food anxiety, or eating disorders</li>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Important Considerations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Food is one factor:</strong> Nutrition supports but doesn't replace mental health treatment</li>
        <li><strong>Individual variation:</strong> What works for one person may not work for another</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid extremes:</strong> Restrictive diets can worsen mental health</li>
        <li><strong>No single superfood:</strong> Overall dietary pattern matters more than any single food</li>
        <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Dietary changes take weeks to affect mental health</li>
        <li><strong>Test, don't guess:</strong> If you suspect deficiencies, get tested</li>
      </ul>
