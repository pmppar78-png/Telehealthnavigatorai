      <p>
        It is normal to feel nervous about virtual appointments, especially if it is your first time. Here are strategies to help:
      </p>

      <h3>Before the Appointment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Practice with the technology:</strong> Familiarity reduces anxiety</li>
        <li><strong>Write everything down:</strong> Knowing you have notes reduces worry about forgetting things</li>

        <li><strong>Prepare your environment:</strong> A calm, organized space helps you feel in control</li>
        <li><strong>Deep breathing:</strong> Practice calming techniques you can use if needed</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>During the Appointment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Remember it is a conversation:</strong> Your provider wants to help you</li>
        <li><strong>Take your time:</strong> It is okay to pause and think before answering</li>
        <li><strong>Use your notes:</strong> Reference your written questions and concerns</li>
        <li><strong>Ask for clarification:</strong> If something is unclear, say so</li>
        <li><strong>Technical issues are normal:</strong> Stay calm if something glitches</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>If Technology Feels Overwhelming</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phone-only option:</strong> Ask if you can do an audio-only call</li>
        <li><strong>Get help:</strong> Have someone tech-savvy assist with setup</li>
        <li><strong>Start simple:</strong> Begin with messaging-based care if available</li>

      <h2>What to Wear for a Telehealth Appointment</h2>
      <p>
        While telehealth allows you to stay home, what you wear can affect your experience:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dress comfortably:</strong> You should feel at ease, but avoid pajamas if it makes you feel less focused</li>
        <li><strong>Consider accessibility:</strong> If the provider might need to see something (like a rash), wear appropriate clothing</li>
        <li><strong>Solid colors work best:</strong> Busy patterns can be distracting on video</li>
        <li><strong>Professional enough:</strong> You do not need to dress up, but being somewhat put-together can help you feel more present</li>
        <li><strong>Layers:</strong> Temperature changes can occur during longer sessions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Involving Family Members or Caregivers</h2>

        <li>When discussing complex treatment decisions</li>
        <li>If you need translation or communication support</li>
        <li>For emotional support during difficult conversations</li>
        <li>When the family member has relevant information to share</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Involve Them</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ask permission first:</strong> Check with your provider if it is okay</li>
        <li><strong>Define their role:</strong> Will they participate or just listen?</li>
        <li><strong>Technical setup:</strong> Ensure they can be seen and heard if needed</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy boundaries:</strong> Decide what topics are okay to discuss with them present</li>
