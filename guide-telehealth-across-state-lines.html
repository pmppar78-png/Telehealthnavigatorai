    <h1>Using Telehealth Across State Lines</h1>
    <p class="legal-date">Published January 2026 · General educational overview – not legal advice</p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <p class="hero-text">
        One of the most common telehealth challenges is maintaining care when you travel, move, or want to see a provider in a different state. This guide explains how state licensing affects telehealth, what options exist for cross-state care, and how to maintain continuity in your treatment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>The Basic Rule: Patient Location Matters</h2>
      <p>
        The fundamental principle of healthcare licensing in the United States:
      </p>
      <div class="legal-note">
        <p>
          <strong>Healthcare providers must be licensed in the state where the patient is physically located at the time of the visit.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        This means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you live in Texas but your therapist is licensed only in California, they generally cannot treat you</li>
        <li>If you travel from New York to Florida for vacation, your New York-licensed provider may not be able to conduct sessions while you're there</li>
        <li>The provider's location doesn't matter – it's where YOU are that counts</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Why These Rules Exist</h2>
      <p>
        State licensing requirements serve important purposes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consumer protection:</strong> Ensures providers meet state-specific standards</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Gives patients a clear path for complaints and discipline</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency response:</strong> Providers know local resources and can coordinate local care</li>
        <li><strong>Legal jurisdiction:</strong> Clear framework for malpractice and liability</li>
        <li><strong>State autonomy:</strong> States regulate healthcare within their borders</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Interstate Licensing Compacts</h2>
      <p>
        Interstate compacts are agreements between states that allow licensed providers to practice across state lines more easily. These compacts are expanding access to telehealth:
      </p>

      <h3>PSYPACT (Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact)</h3>
      <p>
        Allows licensed psychologists to practice telepsychology across participating states.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>40+ states and territories participating</li>
        <li>Psychologists can see patients in any member state</li>
        <li>Requires an E.Passport credential through PSYPACT</li>
        <li>Does not cover in-person practice, only telehealth</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Counseling Compact</h3>
      <p>
        Allows licensed professional counselors (LPCs) to practice across member states.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Growing membership of states</li>
        <li>Covers telehealth and temporary in-person practice</li>
        <li>Requires privilege to practice in member states</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Social Work Licensure Compact</h3>
      <p>
        Newer compact for licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allows practice in member states without additional licenses</li>
        <li>Membership growing as states enact legislation</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC)</h3>
      <p>
        Streamlines licensing for physicians across 40+ states.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expedited pathway to obtain additional state licenses</li>
        <li>Providers still hold individual state licenses</li>
        <li>Useful for telehealth psychiatrists and other medical doctors</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC)</h3>
      <p>
        Allows nurses to practice in any compact state with one multistate license.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>40+ participating states</li>
        <li>Includes RNs and LPNs</li>
        <li>Useful for telehealth nursing services</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Common Scenarios and Solutions</h2>

      <h3>Traveling for Vacation or Work</h3>

        If you'll be in another state temporarily:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inform your provider about your travel dates and locations</li>
        <li>Ask if they're licensed in the state you're visiting (some providers hold multiple licenses)</li>

        <li>Consider rescheduling sessions for before/after your trip</li>
        <li>Some states allow brief continuity of care exceptions – ask your provider</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>College Students</h3>
      <p>
        Students may spend time in multiple states:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Determine your "primary" state (often your school's state during the academic year)</li>
        <li>Ask if your provider is licensed in both your home state and school state</li>
        <li>Use a platform with broad state coverage for flexibility</li>
        <li>Consider your school's counseling center for on-campus support</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Moving to a New State</h3>
      <p>
        If you're relocating permanently:

        <li>Ask for referrals to providers in your new state</li>
        <li>Request your treatment records to share with your new provider</li>
        <li>Some providers hold licenses in multiple states – ask if they can continue treating you</li>
        <li>Plan transition sessions to wrap up current treatment and prepare for the change</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Snowbirds and Part-Year Residents</h3>
      <p>
        If you split time between states:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find a provider licensed in both states (some hold multiple licenses)</li>
        <li>Use a national platform that can match you with providers in each location</li>
        <li>Consider two providers – one for each location – with coordination between them</li>
        <li>Keep records of your treatment to share with providers in each location</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Special Considerations for Medications</h2>
      <p>
        If you receive medication management through telehealth:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prescriptions:</strong> The prescriber must be licensed where you are when the prescription is written</li>
        <li><strong>Controlled substances:</strong> Additional restrictions may apply for ADHD medications, anxiety medications, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Pharmacy:</strong> Prescriptions can typically be filled at any pharmacy, but insurance coverage may vary</li>
        <li><strong>Refills:</strong> Plan ahead for travel – request refills before leaving your home state</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Maintaining Continuity of Care</h2>
      <p>
        Tips for keeping your treatment on track despite state line challenges:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Communicate proactively:</strong> Tell your provider about any upcoming travel or moves</li>
        <li><strong>Keep records:</strong> Maintain copies of your treatment history, diagnoses, and medication lists</li>
        <li><strong>Build a network:</strong> If you split time between states, establish care in each location</li>
        <li><strong>Use technology:</strong> Apps for mood tracking, medication reminders, and journaling don't have state restrictions</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency planning:</strong> Know local crisis resources wherever you are</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>The Future of Interstate Telehealth</h2>
      <p>
        The landscape is improving:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>More compact states:</strong> Interstate compacts continue to add member states</li>
        <li><strong>Federal legislation:</strong> Ongoing discussions about federal telehealth licensing</li>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Questions to Ask Your Provider</h2>
      <p>
        Before starting telehealth, ask:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In which states are you licensed to practice?</li>
        <li>Do you participate in any interstate licensing compacts?</li>
        <li>What happens to my care if I travel out of state?</li>
        <li>Can you provide referrals if I need to transition to a new provider?</li>
        <li>How do you handle prescription refills if I'm traveling?</li>
      </ul>
