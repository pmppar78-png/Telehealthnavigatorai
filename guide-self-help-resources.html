      <h2>How to Use Self-Help Effectively</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose evidence-based resources:</strong> Look for approaches grounded in research (CBT, ACT, mindfulness)</li>
        <li><strong>Be consistent:</strong> Regular practice matters more than occasional intensive effort</li>
        <li><strong>Actually do the exercises:</strong> Reading about techniques doesn't create change—practicing them does</li>
        <li><strong>Track your progress:</strong> Monitor symptoms to see if you're improving</li>
        <li><strong>Set realistic expectations:</strong> Meaningful change takes weeks to months</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overdo it:</strong> Start with one or two resources rather than everything</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluate honestly:</strong> After 4-8 weeks, assess whether you're improving</li>

        <li><strong>Between sessions:</strong> Apps and books can reinforce therapy concepts</li>
        <li><strong>Homework:</strong> Many therapists assign self-help materials</li>

      <h2>Red Flags in Self-Help Resources</h2>
      <p>
        Be cautious of resources that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Promise quick fixes or cures</li>
        <li>Claim to replace professional treatment entirely</li>
        <li>Are created by people without relevant credentials or lived experience</li>
        <li>Focus only on "positive thinking" without addressing real problems</li>
        <li>Cost excessive amounts of money</li>
        <li>Discourage seeking professional help</li>
        <li>Make you feel worse rather than better</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Making the Decision</h2>
      <p>
        Ask yourself:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have my symptoms improved after 4-8 weeks of consistent self-help?</li>
        <li>Am I functioning okay at work, in relationships, and daily life?</li>
        <li>Do I feel like I'm making progress?</li>
        <li>Am I safe? (No thoughts of self-harm)</li>
        <li>Can I manage my emotions most of the time?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you answered "no" to any of these, professional support is likely warranted. There's no shame in needing help—effective treatment can significantly improve your life.
