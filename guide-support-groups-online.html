      <h2>Making the Most of Support Groups</h2>

      <h3>Before Joining</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify what you're looking for (validation, practical tips, community)</li>
        <li>Research the group's approach and guidelines</li>
        <li>Check if it requires commitment or is drop-in</li>
        <li>Consider trying a few groups to find the right fit</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>During Groups</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Listen actively to others</li>
        <li>Share at your comfort level—no pressure to disclose everything</li>
        <li>Be respectful of others' experiences</li>
        <li>Offer support without giving advice (unless asked)</li>
        <li>Follow group guidelines</li>
        <li>Take what helps, leave what doesn't</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>After Groups</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reflect on what resonated</li>
        <li>Practice any strategies that seem helpful</li>
        <li>Maintain boundaries—groups support but don't replace your own support system</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cautions and Safety</h2>

        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Be cautious about sharing identifying information online</li>
        <li><strong>Not treatment:</strong> Support groups complement but don't replace professional care</li>
