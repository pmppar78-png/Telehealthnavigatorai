    <h1>Psychosis &amp; Telehealth Support</h1>
    <p class="legal-date">Educational information – not medical advice or diagnosis</p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <p class="hero-text">Psychosis refers to experiences where someone loses touch with reality, often involving hallucinations or delusions. It can be frightening for both the person experiencing it and their loved ones. Understanding psychosis and knowing where to find help is an important first step. This guide provides educational information about psychosis and how telehealth may support care.</p>

      <h2>Understanding Psychosis</h2>
      <p>Psychosis is not a condition itself, but rather a collection of symptoms that can occur in various mental health conditions. During a psychotic episode, a person's thoughts and perceptions are disrupted, making it difficult to distinguish what is real from what is not.</p>

      <h3>Common Symptoms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hallucinations:</strong> Sensing things that aren't there—most commonly hearing voices, but can also include seeing, feeling, smelling, or tasting things others don't perceive</li>
        <li><strong>Delusions:</strong> Strongly held beliefs that aren't based in reality—such as believing one is being watched, has special powers, or is receiving hidden messages</li>
        <li><strong>Disorganized thinking:</strong> Difficulty organizing thoughts, speaking in ways that are hard to follow, jumping between unrelated topics</li>
        <li><strong>Altered behavior:</strong> Acting in unusual ways, difficulty with daily activities, social withdrawal</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conditions That May Include Psychosis</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder</li>
        <li>Bipolar disorder with psychotic features</li>
        <li>Major depression with psychotic features</li>
        <li>Brief psychotic disorder</li>
        <li>Substance-induced psychosis</li>
        <li>Medical conditions affecting the brain</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Only qualified healthcare professionals can determine the cause of psychotic symptoms through comprehensive evaluation.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>The Importance of Early Intervention</h2>
      <p>Early intervention in psychosis leads to significantly better outcomes. The period before and during a first episode of psychosis, often called the "prodrome," may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Difficulty thinking clearly or concentrating</li>
        <li>Suspiciousness or uneasiness around others</li>
        <li>Decline in self-care or personal hygiene</li>
        <li>Spending more time alone than usual</li>
        <li>Strong emotions or no emotions at all</li>
        <li>Unusual or exaggerated beliefs</li>
        <li>Hearing, seeing, or sensing things others don't</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you notice these changes in yourself or someone you care about, reaching out to a mental health professional can make a meaningful difference.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Treatment Approaches</h2>
      <p>Psychosis is treatable. Many people who experience psychosis recover well with proper care:</p>

      <h3>Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC)</h3>
      <p>The gold standard for first-episode psychosis is coordinated specialty care, which includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Medication management</li>
        <li>Individual and/or family therapy</li>
        <li>Supported education and employment</li>
        <li>Case management</li>
        <li>Peer support</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Medication</h3>
      <p>Antipsychotic medications help manage symptoms and reduce the risk of future episodes. Finding the right medication and dose often takes time and careful monitoring with a psychiatrist.</p>

      <h3>Therapy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis (CBTp):</strong> Helps develop coping strategies for symptoms</li>
        <li><strong>Family therapy:</strong> Supports family understanding and communication</li>
        <li><strong>Social skills training:</strong> Builds confidence in social situations</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Role of Telehealth</h2>
      <p>While active psychosis typically requires in-person care, telehealth can support treatment in several ways:</p>

      <h3>Appropriate Uses of Telehealth</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Follow-up appointments:</strong> Once stable, routine check-ins with psychiatrists and therapists</li>
        <li><strong>Medication monitoring:</strong> Regular reviews of medication effectiveness and side effects</li>
        <li><strong>Family sessions:</strong> Include family members in treatment regardless of location</li>
        <li><strong>Early intervention:</strong> Quick access to providers when warning signs emerge</li>
        <li><strong>Care coordination:</strong> Communication between treatment team members</li>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Learning about the condition and recovery</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>When In-Person Care Is Needed</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>During active psychotic episodes</li>
        <li>Initial evaluation and diagnosis</li>
        <li>When safety is a concern</li>
        <li>Significant medication changes</li>
        <li>When symptoms interfere with virtual communication</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Resources and Support</h2>
