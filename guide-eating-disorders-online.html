      <h2>Understanding Eating Disorders</h2>
      <p>
        Eating disorders involve complex relationships with food, body image, and eating behaviors. They affect people of all ages, genders, and backgrounds. Common types include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Anorexia Nervosa:</strong> Severe restriction of food intake, intense fear of weight gain, and distorted body image</li>
        <li><strong>Bulimia Nervosa:</strong> Cycles of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors like purging</li>
        <li><strong>Binge Eating Disorder:</strong> Recurring episodes of eating large amounts with feelings of loss of control</li>
        <li><strong>Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID):</strong> Extremely limited food preferences not related to body image concerns</li>
        <li><strong>Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED):</strong> Clinically significant eating disorder symptoms that don't meet full criteria for other diagnoses</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Only licensed healthcare professionals can diagnose eating disorders. Early intervention improves outcomes significantly.

      <h2>How Online Treatment Can Help</h2>

        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Connect with eating disorder specialists who may not be available locally</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Maintain treatment during travel, transitions, or schedule challenges</li>
        <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Discuss sensitive topics from a private, familiar environment</li>

      <h2>Evidence-Based Treatment Approaches</h2>

      <h3>Family-Based Treatment (FBT)</h3>
      <p>
        The leading treatment for adolescents with eating disorders, FBT involves parents as active participants in their child's recovery. Virtual FBT has shown effectiveness comparable to in-person treatment.
      </p>

      <h3>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Eating Disorders (CBT-E)</h3>
      <p>
        A specialized form of CBT that addresses the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors maintaining the eating disorder.
      </p>

      <h3>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</h3>
      <p>
        Helps develop skills for emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness.
      </p>

      <h3>Nutrition Counseling</h3>
      <p>
        Working with registered dietitians who specialize in eating disorders to develop healthy relationships with food.
      </p>

      <h3>Medical Monitoring</h3>
      <p>
        Regular check-ins with physicians to monitor physical health throughout recovery.

      <h2>Levels of Care</h2>
