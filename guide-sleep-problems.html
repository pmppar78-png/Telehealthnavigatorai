      <h2>The Sleep-Mental Health Connection</h2>
      <p>
        Sleep and mental health are deeply interconnected:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Anxiety:</strong> Racing thoughts and worry can make falling asleep difficult; poor sleep worsens anxiety</li>
        <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Can cause insomnia or excessive sleep; sleep problems worsen depression symptoms</li>
        <li><strong>Stress:</strong> Activates the body's alert system, making restful sleep harder</li>
        <li><strong>PTSD:</strong> Often involves nightmares and hypervigilance that disrupt sleep</li>
        <li><strong>Bipolar disorder:</strong> Sleep changes often signal mood episode shifts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Addressing sleep problems often improves mental health symptoms, and vice versa.

      <h2>Telehealth Options for Sleep Problems</h2>

      <h3>Therapy for Sleep (CBT-I)</h3>
      <p>
        Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is the gold-standard, first-line treatment for chronic insomnia. It's more effective than sleep medications long-term and includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sleep hygiene education:</strong> Optimizing your sleep environment and habits</li>
        <li><strong>Stimulus control:</strong> Rebuilding the association between bed and sleep</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep restriction:</strong> Temporarily limiting time in bed to consolidate sleep</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive restructuring:</strong> Addressing thoughts and beliefs that perpetuate insomnia</li>
        <li><strong>Relaxation training:</strong> Techniques to calm body and mind</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        CBT-I is highly effective via telehealth and often produces lasting results in 6-8 sessions.
      </p>

      <h3>Therapy for Underlying Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        If sleep problems are connected to anxiety, depression, PTSD, or other conditions, treating those issues often improves sleep.
      </p>

      <h3>Psychiatry/Medication</h3>
      <p>
        While CBT-I is preferred, some people benefit from short-term sleep medication or medication for underlying conditions affecting sleep.
      </p>

      <h3>Primary Care Telehealth</h3>
      <p>
        For ruling out medical causes or getting referrals for conditions like sleep apnea that require testing.

        <li><strong>Dark, cool, quiet room:</strong> Optimize your sleep environment</li>

        <li><strong>Watch caffeine:</strong> Avoid caffeine after early afternoon</li>
        <li><strong>Limit alcohol:</strong> While it may help you fall asleep, it disrupts sleep quality</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise regularly:</strong> But not too close to bedtime</li>
        <li><strong>Wind-down routine:</strong> Relaxing activities before bed</li>
        <li><strong>Reserve bed for sleep:</strong> Avoid working, watching TV, or scrolling in bed</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>When In-Person Care Is Needed</h2>
      <p>
        Some sleep issues require in-person evaluation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Suspected sleep apnea:</strong> Requires sleep study (some can be done at home)</li>
        <li><strong>Narcolepsy:</strong> Requires specialized testing</li>
        <li><strong>Parasomnia:</strong> Sleepwalking, acting out dreams may need evaluation</li>
        <li><strong>Medical conditions:</strong> Some conditions affecting sleep need physical exam</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A telehealth provider can help you determine if you need in-person evaluation.
