    <h1>Medicaid & State Healthcare Insurance: Telehealth Coverage</h1>
    <p class="legal-date">Published January 2026 · General educational overview – coverage varies by state program</p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <p class="hero-text">
        Medicaid provides health coverage to millions of Americans, and telehealth has become an increasingly important part of that coverage. However, because Medicaid is <strong>federally funded but administered by each state under different program names</strong> (such as MassHealth in Massachusetts, Medi-Cal in California, or Apple Health in Washington), telehealth coverage varies significantly depending on where you live. This guide explains how Medicaid telehealth generally works, lists state-specific program names, and helps you understand what to know about accessing virtual care through state-sponsored health insurance.

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Understanding Medicaid and Telehealth</h2>
      <p>
        Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides health coverage to eligible low-income individuals and families. While funded partially by the federal government, <strong>each state administers its own Medicaid program under a different name</strong>. This means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Telehealth coverage rules vary from state to state</li>
        <li>Covered services differ based on your state's Medicaid plan</li>
        <li>Many states have expanded telehealth coverage permanently after the pandemic</li>
        <li>You may receive Medicaid through a managed care organization (MCO) with its own telehealth rules</li>
        <li>Your state's program may be called something other than "Medicaid" (see state program names below)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>State-Sponsored Medicaid Program Names</h2>
      <p>
        Medicaid programs are administered under different names in each state. When searching for providers, verifying coverage, or applying for benefits, you may need to use your state's specific program name. Here are the Medicaid program names by state:

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Finding Telehealth Providers Who Accept Medicaid</h2>
      <p>
        Finding telehealth providers who accept Medicaid can be challenging, but options exist:

    <section class="legal-section">

        <li><strong>Some states still have restrictions:</strong> A few may require you to be at a medical facility</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Provider Types</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Which provider types can deliver telehealth services</li>
        <li>Whether out-of-state providers can treat Medicaid patients via telehealth</li>

        <li>Some limit audio-only to behavioral health or established patients</li>
        <li>Reimbursement rates may differ from video visits</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
