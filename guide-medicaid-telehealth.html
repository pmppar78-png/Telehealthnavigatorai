    <h1>Medicaid & Telehealth Coverage</h1>
    <p class="legal-date">General educational overview – coverage varies by state</p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <p class="hero-text">
        Medicaid provides health coverage to millions of Americans, and telehealth has become an increasingly important part of that coverage. However, because Medicaid is administered at the state level, telehealth coverage varies significantly depending on where you live. This guide explains how Medicaid telehealth generally works and what to know about accessing virtual care.

      <h2>Understanding Medicaid and Telehealth</h2>
      <p>
        Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides health coverage to eligible low-income individuals and families. Each state runs its own Medicaid program within federal guidelines, which means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Telehealth coverage rules vary from state to state</li>
        <li>Covered services differ based on your state's Medicaid plan</li>
        <li>Many states have expanded telehealth coverage permanently after the pandemic</li>
        <li>You may receive Medicaid through a managed care organization (MCO) with its own telehealth rules</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>What Telehealth Services Does Medicaid Typically Cover?</h2>

      <h2>Medicaid Managed Care and Telehealth</h2>

        <li>Telehealth rules may differ from fee-for-service Medicaid</li>
        <li>Some MCOs partner with specific telehealth platforms</li>
        <li>Contact your MCO directly to understand your telehealth benefits</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your MCO may have a telehealth service built into your benefits or partnerships with platforms that serve Medicaid members.
