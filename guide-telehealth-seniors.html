      <h2>Medicare Coverage for Telehealth</h2>
      <p>
        Medicare has significantly expanded telehealth coverage in recent years:
      </p>

      <h3>What Medicare Typically Covers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Video visits with doctors and specialists</li>
        <li>Mental health services including therapy and psychiatry</li>
        <li>Chronic care management visits</li>
        <li>Annual wellness visits (may be offered virtually)</li>
        <li>Many preventive services</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Understanding Your Coverage</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Original Medicare (Parts A & B):</strong> Covers many telehealth services; you typically pay 20% after deductible</li>
        <li><strong>Medicare Advantage (Part C):</strong> Often includes additional telehealth benefits; check your specific plan</li>
        <li><strong>Medigap:</strong> May help cover your share of telehealth costs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Verify Coverage</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Call Medicare at 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227)</li>
        <li>Log into your Medicare.gov account</li>
        <li>Contact your Medicare Advantage plan directly</li>
        <li>Ask your healthcare provider's billing department</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Audio-Only Visits</h3>
      <p>
        Medicare also covers many services via phone calls (audio-only), which can be helpful if video technology is challenging. This is especially important for mental health services.
      </p>

      <h2>Getting Help with Technology</h2>
      <p>

      <h2>Common Concerns Addressed</h2>

      <h3>"I'm not good with technology"</h3>
      <p>
        Many telehealth platforms are designed to be simple. You often just click one link or button to join. Phone visits require no technology beyond your telephone. Ask for help—providers want you to succeed.
      </p>

      <h3>"Is it as good as in-person care?"</h3>
      <p>
        For many conditions, telehealth is equally effective. It's especially good for follow-ups, medication management, and mental health care. Your provider will tell you if an in-person visit is needed.
      </p>

      <h3>"Is it private and secure?"</h3>
      <p>
        Legitimate telehealth services use secure, HIPAA-compliant technology. Your health information is protected just like in-person visits.
      </p>

      <h3>"What if I have hearing or vision problems?"</h3>
      <p>
        Let your provider know about any challenges. They can speak louder, use larger text, or offer phone visits. Hearing aids often connect to phones and tablets directly.
