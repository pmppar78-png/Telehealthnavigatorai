    <h1>Autism &amp; Telehealth Support</h1>
    <p class="legal-date">Educational information – not medical advice or diagnosis</p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <p class="hero-text">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication, sensory processing, and patterns of behavior and interests. While autism itself doesn't require "treatment," many autistic individuals benefit from support services, mental health care, and accommodations. Telehealth has expanded access to autism-informed care. This guide provides educational information about autism and how virtual services may help.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Understanding Autism</h2>
      <p>Autism is a spectrum condition, meaning it presents differently in different people. It's a neurological difference, not a disease or deficiency. Autistic individuals have unique strengths alongside challenges.</p>

      <h3>Common Characteristics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Social communication differences:</strong> Different ways of communicating, understanding social cues, or building relationships</li>
        <li><strong>Sensory sensitivities:</strong> Over- or under-sensitivity to sounds, lights, textures, tastes, or other sensory input</li>
        <li><strong>Focused interests:</strong> Deep, passionate interests in specific topics</li>
        <li><strong>Preference for routine:</strong> Finding comfort in predictability and structure</li>
        <li><strong>Stimming:</strong> Repetitive movements or sounds that help with regulation</li>
        <li><strong>Different ways of thinking:</strong> Unique perspectives, pattern recognition, or problem-solving approaches</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Autism Across the Lifespan</h3>
      <p>Autism is a lifelong condition. Many people are diagnosed in childhood, but increasing numbers are receiving diagnoses in adolescence or adulthood, particularly those who developed coping strategies that masked their autism (often called "masking" or "camouflaging").</p>

      <p>Only qualified professionals can diagnose autism through comprehensive evaluation. If you're wondering whether you might be autistic, consider seeking assessment from a professional with autism expertise.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Mental Health and Autism</h2>
      <p>Autistic individuals experience higher rates of certain mental health conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Anxiety:</strong> Very common, often related to sensory overload, social situations, or uncertainty</li>
        <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Can result from masking, social isolation, or lack of acceptance</li>
        <li><strong>ADHD:</strong> Frequently co-occurs with autism</li>
        <li><strong>Burnout:</strong> Exhaustion from the demands of navigating a neurotypical world</li>
        <li><strong>Trauma:</strong> Higher rates due to bullying, misunderstanding, or inappropriate past treatments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finding mental health providers who understand autism is important—therapy that isn't autism-informed can be unhelpful or even harmful.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Why Telehealth Can Work Well for Autistic Individuals</h2>
      <p>Many autistic people find telehealth particularly comfortable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sensory control:</strong> Manage your environment—lighting, sounds, temperature</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced social demands:</strong> Less nonverbal communication to process</li>
        <li><strong>Familiar space:</strong> Sessions from the comfort of home</li>
        <li><strong>No travel stress:</strong> Avoid sensory challenges of waiting rooms and transportation</li>
        <li><strong>Stimming freedom:</strong> More comfortable engaging in regulatory behaviors</li>
        <li><strong>Communication options:</strong> Some platforms allow text-based communication</li>
        <li><strong>Access to specialists:</strong> Autism-informed providers may be limited locally</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">

      <h2>A Note on Controversial Treatments</h2>
      <p>Some approaches marketed for autism are harmful or not supported by evidence:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis):</strong> Traditional ABA has been criticized by many autistic adults; if considering behavioral support, look for naturalistic, play-based approaches that respect the autistic person's autonomy</li>
        <li><strong>"Cures" or treatments to eliminate autism:</strong> Autism is not a disease; avoid anything promising to "cure" or "recover" from autism</li>
        <li><strong>Unproven biomedical interventions:</strong> Many lack evidence and some are dangerous</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Look for services that support autistic individuals in living fulfilling lives as their authentic selves.</p>
