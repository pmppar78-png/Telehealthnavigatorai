    <h1>HIPAA & Your Privacy in Telehealth</h1>
    <p class="legal-date">Published January 2026 · General educational overview – not legal advice</p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <p class="hero-text">
        Your health information deserves strong protection, whether you see a provider in person or through telehealth. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provides federal privacy protections that apply to your virtual healthcare. This guide explains how HIPAA protects you and what to look for in telehealth privacy practices.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>What Is HIPAA?</h2>
      <p>
        HIPAA is a federal law enacted in 1996 that establishes national standards for protecting sensitive health information. It consists of several key rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Privacy Rule:</strong> Establishes national standards for protecting individuals' medical records and personal health information</li>
        <li><strong>Security Rule:</strong> Sets standards for protecting electronic health information (e-PHI)</li>
        <li><strong>Breach Notification Rule:</strong> Requires covered entities to notify patients when their information is compromised</li>
        <li><strong>Enforcement Rule:</strong> Contains provisions for compliance and penalties for violations</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Who Must Comply with HIPAA?</h2>
      <p>
        HIPAA applies to "covered entities" and their "business associates":
      </p>

      <h3>Covered Entities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Healthcare providers (doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, nurses, etc.)</li>
        <li>Health plans (insurance companies, HMOs, employer health plans)</li>
        <li>Healthcare clearinghouses (entities that process health information)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Business Associates</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Telehealth platform vendors</li>
        <li>IT companies that handle health data</li>
        <li>Billing services</li>
        <li>Cloud storage providers for health data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This means telehealth platforms like <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">BetterHelp</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Talkspace</a>, <a href="https://www.headway.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Headway</a>, and <a href="https://www.teladoc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Teladoc</a> must comply with HIPAA requirements.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Your Rights Under HIPAA</h2>
      <p>

    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>How HIPAA Applies to Telehealth</h2>
      <p>
        HIPAA requirements apply equally to telehealth and in-person care:
      </p>

      <h3>Technical Safeguards</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Video calls and messages must be encrypted during transmission</li>
        <li><strong>Access controls:</strong> Only authorized users can access your information</li>
        <li><strong>Audit controls:</strong> Systems must track who accesses what and when</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic logoff:</strong> Sessions end after inactivity</li>
        <li><strong>Transmission security:</strong> Protections against interception of communications</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Administrative Safeguards</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Staff training on privacy and security</li>
        <li>Risk assessments and management</li>
        <li>Policies and procedures for handling health information</li>
        <li>Incident response plans for potential breaches</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Physical Safeguards</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Secure data centers for stored information</li>
        <li>Workstation and device security</li>
        <li>Proper disposal of devices containing health information</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>HIPAA-Compliant Telehealth Platforms</h2>

        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>What's NOT Covered by HIPAA</h2>
      <p>
        Important: Not all health-related apps and services are covered by HIPAA:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>General wellness apps:</strong> Meditation apps, fitness trackers, sleep apps</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer health apps:</strong> Apps you download directly (not through a healthcare provider)</li>
        <li><strong>Educational resources:</strong> Health information websites and content</li>
        <li><strong>Social media health groups:</strong> Online communities and forums</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Apps like <a href="https://www.calm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Calm</a>, <a href="https://www.headspace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Headspace</a>, and general wellness tools may not be bound by HIPAA. Review their privacy policies carefully.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Mental Health Records: Extra Protections</h2>
      <p>
        Mental health information often has enhanced privacy protections:
      </p>

      <h3>Psychotherapy Notes</h3>
      <p>
        Under HIPAA, "psychotherapy notes" have special protections:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Separate from your general medical record</li>
        <li>Require specific authorization to release (with limited exceptions)</li>
        <li>Not included in standard record requests</li>
        <li>Not required for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: Not all therapy notes qualify as "psychotherapy notes" under HIPAA. The term has a specific legal definition.
      </p>

      <h3>Substance Abuse Records</h3>
      <p>
        Federal regulation 42 CFR Part 2 provides additional protections for substance abuse treatment records, requiring explicit consent for most disclosures.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Limits to Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>
        HIPAA allows (and sometimes requires) disclosure without your consent in certain situations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Imminent danger:</strong> Serious and imminent threat to health or safety</li>
        <li><strong>Abuse or neglect:</strong> Reporting suspected child, elder, or dependent adult abuse</li>
        <li><strong>Court orders:</strong> Valid court orders or subpoenas</li>
        <li><strong>Law enforcement:</strong> Certain law enforcement purposes</li>
        <li><strong>Public health:</strong> Required public health reporting</li>
        <li><strong>Worker's compensation:</strong> Information needed for claims</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your provider should explain these limits during your first session.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Protecting Your Own Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        HIPAA protects your data in the healthcare system, but you also play a role in protecting your telehealth privacy:
      </p>

      <h3>During Telehealth Sessions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a private space where you won't be overheard</li>
        <li>Wear headphones for audio privacy</li>
        <li>Position your screen so others can't see it</li>
        <li>Consider a white noise machine or app</li>
        <li>Lock doors if possible</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technical Security</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use secure, private Wi-Fi (not public networks)</li>
        <li>Keep your devices updated with security patches</li>
        <li>Use strong, unique passwords</li>
        <li>Enable two-factor authentication</li>
        <li>Log out completely after sessions</li>
        <li>Be cautious about saving login credentials on shared devices</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Communication Privacy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the platform's secure messaging rather than regular email or text</li>
        <li>Be mindful of what you put in writing</li>
        <li>Set up notifications carefully to protect privacy</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>What to Do If You Think Your Privacy Was Violated</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Document the issue:</strong> Write down what happened, when, and who was involved</li>
        <li><strong>Contact the provider/platform:</strong> Many issues can be resolved at this level</li>
        <li><strong>Request a breach determination:</strong> Ask if a breach occurred and what steps are being taken</li>
        <li><strong>File a complaint with HHS OCR:</strong> You can file online at hhs.gov/ocr/complaints</li>
        <li><strong>Contact your state:</strong> State attorneys general may also investigate</li>
        <li><strong>Consult an attorney:</strong> For serious violations with harm, legal consultation may be appropriate</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Questions to Ask About Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Before using a telehealth service:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is this platform HIPAA-compliant?</li>
        <li>How is my data encrypted during sessions and in storage?</li>
        <li>Who has access to my health information?</li>
        <li>Is any data shared with third parties? For what purposes?</li>
        <li>Are video sessions recorded? If so, how are recordings protected?</li>
        <li>How long is my data retained?</li>
        <li>How can I access, download, or delete my data?</li>
        <li>What happens to my data if I cancel my account?</li>
      </ul>
