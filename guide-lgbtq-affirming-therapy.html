      <h2>Why LGBTQ+ Affirming Care Matters</h2>
      <p>
        LGBTQ+ individuals face unique stressors and mental health challenges:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Minority stress:</strong> The cumulative impact of discrimination, prejudice, and stigma</li>
        <li><strong>Coming out experiences:</strong> Navigating identity disclosure with family, friends, and workplace</li>
        <li><strong>Family rejection:</strong> Processing and healing from non-acceptance</li>
        <li><strong>Internalized stigma:</strong> Working through shame or negative self-beliefs</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship challenges:</strong> Issues specific to LGBTQ+ relationships and dating</li>
        <li><strong>Gender identity:</strong> Support for gender exploration, transition, and dysphoria</li>
        <li><strong>Intersectionality:</strong> Multiple marginalized identities and their impacts</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare discrimination:</strong> Past negative experiences with providers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        An affirming therapist understands these experiences and creates a safe space where you can be fully yourself.
      </p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>What Makes Therapy "LGBTQ+ Affirming"?</h2>
      <p>
        Affirming care goes beyond simply accepting LGBTQ+ clients. Look for therapists who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Understand LGBTQ+ experiences:</strong> Have training and knowledge specific to the community</li>
        <li><strong>Use correct names and pronouns:</strong> Consistently and without being reminded</li>
        <li><strong>Don't pathologize identity:</strong> Treat LGBTQ+ identities as normal variations, not disorders</li>
        <li><strong>Address minority stress:</strong> Recognize the impact of discrimination on mental health</li>
        <li><strong>Stay current:</strong> Keep up with evolving terminology and community needs</li>
        <li><strong>Advocate when needed:</strong> Help navigate systems and provide appropriate referrals</li>
        <li><strong>Acknowledge their own learning:</strong> Are humble about gaps in knowledge</li>
        <li><strong>Don't make assumptions:</strong> Ask rather than assume about identity, relationships, or experiences</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Red Flags to Avoid</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Any mention of "conversion" or changing sexual orientation/gender identity</li>
        <li>Treating your identity as "the problem" to be solved</li>
        <li>Consistently using wrong pronouns or deadnaming</li>
        <li>Excessive curiosity about physical aspects of transition</li>
        <li>Suggesting you're "going through a phase"</li>
        <li>Lack of knowledge about basic LGBTQ+ terms and experiences</li>
        <li>Religious or moral judgments about your identity</li>
      </ul>
