      <h2>Understanding Telehealth</h2>
      <p>
        Telehealth is a broad term describing the use of digital technologies to deliver healthcare services, education, and information remotely. Rather than traveling to a clinic or office, patients can connect with healthcare providers through:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Video visits:</strong> Live video calls that simulate an in-person appointment</li>
        <li><strong>Phone consultations:</strong> Voice calls with healthcare providers</li>
        <li><strong>Asynchronous messaging:</strong> Secure messaging where you send information and receive responses later</li>
        <li><strong>Remote monitoring:</strong> Using devices to track health data that providers can review</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile health apps:</strong> Applications that support health management and provider communication</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Limitations of Telehealth</h2>
      <p>
        Telehealth is not appropriate for all healthcare needs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Emergencies:</strong> Telehealth cannot handle emergencies—call 911 for urgent situations</li>
        <li><strong>Physical examinations:</strong> Some conditions require hands-on assessment</li>
        <li><strong>Certain procedures:</strong> Lab work, imaging, injections, and surgeries require in-person visits</li>
        <li><strong>Complex diagnoses:</strong> Some conditions need comprehensive in-person evaluation</li>
        <li><strong>Technology barriers:</strong> Requires reliable internet and basic tech comfort</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy concerns:</strong> May be challenging to find private space at home</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Is Telehealth Right for You?</h2>
      <p>
        Consider telehealth if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You have non-emergency health concerns</li>
        <li>You have reliable internet and a device with camera/microphone</li>

        <li>Your healthcare needs can be addressed without physical examination</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The best way to determine if telehealth is appropriate for your specific situation is to discuss it with a healthcare provider.
