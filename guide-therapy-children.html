      <h2>Can Online Therapy Work for Children?</h2>
      <p>
        Research shows that telehealth can be effective for many childhood mental health concerns, though effectiveness varies by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> Older children and adolescents often adapt well; younger children may need modified approaches</li>
        <li><strong>Condition:</strong> Many conditions respond well to online treatment; some may require in-person care</li>
        <li><strong>Child's temperament:</strong> Some children engage better virtually; others need in-person connection</li>
        <li><strong>Family involvement:</strong> Parent participation is crucial for younger children</li>
        <li><strong>Therapist expertise:</strong> Experience with both children AND telehealth matters</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Good Candidates for Online Therapy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Children with anxiety who may feel more comfortable at home</li>

        <li>Children with physical health issues making travel difficult</li>
        <li>Situations requiring ongoing care during schedule constraints</li>
        <li>Follow-up and maintenance therapy after initial in-person treatment</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>May Need In-Person Care Instead</h3>
      <ul>

        <li>Children with severe attention difficulties</li>
        <li>Situations involving safety concerns</li>
        <li>When physical assessment is needed</li>
