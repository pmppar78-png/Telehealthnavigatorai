      <h2>Understanding Social Anxiety Disorder</h2>
      <p>
        Social anxiety disorder (also called social phobia) involves intense fear of social situations where you might be judged, embarrassed, or scrutinized by others. It goes beyond normal shyness or nervousness:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Intensity:</strong> Fear is excessive and often recognized as unreasonable</li>
        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Anxiety persists for six months or longer</li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Significantly interferes with daily life, work, or relationships</li>
        <li><strong>Avoidance:</strong> Social situations are avoided or endured with intense distress</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">

      <h2>Why Online Therapy Works for Social Anxiety</h2>

        <li><strong>Comfort of home:</strong> Begin therapy in a safe, familiar environment</li>
        <li><strong>Gradual exposure:</strong> Video sessions can be a stepping stone to in-person interactions</li>

        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Schedule sessions around work without worrying about being seen</li>

      <h2>Evidence-Based Treatments for Social Anxiety</h2>

      <h3>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h3>
      <p>
        The gold standard treatment for social anxiety, CBT addresses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cognitive restructuring:</strong> Identifying and challenging anxious thoughts</li>
        <li><strong>Exposure:</strong> Gradually facing feared social situations</li>
        <li><strong>Behavioral experiments:</strong> Testing predictions about social outcomes</li>
        <li><strong>Attention training:</strong> Shifting focus away from self-monitoring</li>
        <li><strong>Social skills:</strong> Building confidence in social interactions</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Exposure Therapy</h3>
      <p>
        Systematic, gradual exposure to feared social situations—the most powerful component of treatment. Online therapy can incorporate virtual exposure exercises.
      </p>

      <h3>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</h3>
      <p>
        Focuses on accepting anxious feelings while taking action aligned with personal values, reducing the struggle against anxiety.
      </p>

      <h3>Social Skills Training</h3>
      <p>
        For those who would benefit from developing specific social skills, such as conversation starters, active listening, or assertiveness.
      </p>

      <h3>Medication</h3>
      <p>
        SSRIs and SNRIs can help reduce social anxiety symptoms. Medication is often most effective when combined with therapy.
