    <h1>About Telehealth Navigator AI</h1>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Telehealth Navigator AI was created to address a real problem: the overwhelming complexity of navigating online mental health care options. With dozens of platforms competing for attention, varying pricing models, confusing insurance landscapes, and high-stakes decisions, people searching for help often find the process itself adds to their stress.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that understanding your healthcare options shouldn't require a medical degree or hours of research through marketing materials. Our mission is to provide a calm, pressure-free environment where adults can learn about telehealth, online therapy, psychiatry, and related services—and feel genuinely prepared when they're ready to connect with licensed healthcare professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're here to inform and empower, never to replace the professional guidance that only licensed clinicians can provide.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Telehealth Navigator AI is an educational technology platform headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. We specialize in creating clear, accessible information about the telehealth industry, online therapy options, and digital mental health resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important clarification:</strong> We are a technology and information service—not a healthcare provider. We do not employ medical doctors, licensed therapists, psychiatrists, or clinical practitioners who provide care through this platform. We do not diagnose conditions, provide treatment, prescribe medications, or offer personalized medical or mental health advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, we focus on what we do exceptionally well: synthesizing complex information about the telehealth landscape into clear, actionable educational resources. We help adults understand their options, compare services thoughtfully, and approach conversations with healthcare professionals more confidently.
