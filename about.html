    <h1>About Telehealth Navigator AI</h1>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Telehealth Navigator AI was created to help people navigate the often-overwhelming world of telehealth and online therapy options. We understand that seeking mental health support or medical care online can feel confusing, with dozens of platforms, varying costs, and complex insurance questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is simple: provide a calm, pressure-free space where you can learn about your options, understand the differences between services, and feel more confident when you're ready to reach out to a licensed healthcare professional.

      <h2>What We Are Not</h2>
      <p>
        It is important to understand what Telehealth Navigator AI is <strong>not</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Not a healthcare provider:</strong> We do not diagnose, treat, or prescribe. We are an informational resource only.</li>
        <li><strong>Not a crisis service:</strong> If you are in danger or experiencing a mental health emergency, please contact emergency services (911) or a crisis hotline immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Not a replacement for professional advice:</strong> Our AI provides general information, not personalized medical or mental health advice. Always consult licensed professionals for care decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Not staffed by healthcare professionals:</strong> Our website is an educational technology platform, not a medical practice.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Our Approach to Information</h2>
      <p>
        We take accuracy and responsibility seriously. Here's how we approach the information on our site:

        <li><strong>No personalized recommendations:</strong> We do not recommend specific treatments or diagnoses. We encourage users to work with licensed professionals.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency about limitations:</strong> Our AI clearly states what it cannot do (diagnose, treat, prescribe, handle emergencies).</li>
        <li><strong>Regular review:</strong> We periodically review our content to ensure it remains accurate and helpful.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear disclaimers:</strong> We provide prominent disclaimers throughout the site to ensure users understand the nature and limitations of our service.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>About Our AI Technology</h2>
      <p>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Respond in a calm, supportive, and non-judgmental tone</li>
        <li>Provide general information about telehealth options</li>
        <li>Encourage users to seek professional help when appropriate</li>
        <li>Refuse to provide medical advice, diagnoses, or crisis intervention</li>
        <li>Direct users to emergency services when crisis situations are detected</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> AI technology has limitations. Responses may occasionally be incomplete, inaccurate, or not fully relevant to your situation. Always verify important information with qualified professionals.
