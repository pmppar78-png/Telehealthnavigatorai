    <h1>About Telehealth Navigator AI</h1>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Telehealth Navigator AI was created to help people navigate the often-overwhelming world of telehealth and online therapy options. We understand that seeking mental health support or medical care online can feel confusing, with dozens of platforms, varying costs, and complex insurance questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is simple: provide a calm, pressure-free space where you can learn about your options, understand the differences between services, and feel more confident when you're ready to reach out to a licensed healthcare professional.
      </p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Telehealth Navigator AI is an educational technology platform operated from Boston, Massachusetts. Our team includes professionals with backgrounds in health technology, digital communications, and consumer education.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important clarification:</strong> We are a technology and information service—not a healthcare provider. Our team does not include medical doctors, licensed therapists, or clinical practitioners who provide care through this platform. We do not diagnose, treat, or provide personalized medical or mental health advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, we focus on what we do well: creating clear, accessible educational content about telehealth as an industry, helping adults understand their options, and encouraging them to make informed decisions with qualified healthcare professionals.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Our Editorial Standards</h2>
      <p>
        We take accuracy and responsibility seriously in all content we publish. Our approach to information includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>General information only:</strong> We provide educational content about telehealth as an industry, not specific medical or mental health guidance.</li>
        <li><strong>No personalized recommendations:</strong> We do not recommend specific treatments, diagnoses, or courses of action for individual situations.</li>
        <li><strong>Source verification:</strong> When we include factual information about telehealth services, insurance, or healthcare topics, we aim to use publicly available information from the services themselves or reputable sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear limitations:</strong> Our AI and all content clearly state what we cannot do (diagnose, treat, prescribe, handle emergencies).</li>
        <li><strong>Regular review:</strong> We periodically review our content to help ensure it remains accurate, helpful, and compliant with best practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Prominent disclaimers:</strong> Every page includes clear disclaimers so users understand the nature and limitations of our service.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>What We Are Not</h2>
      <p>
        It is important to understand what Telehealth Navigator AI is <strong>not</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Not a healthcare provider:</strong> We do not diagnose, treat, prescribe, or provide clinical care. We are an informational resource only.</li>
        <li><strong>Not a crisis service:</strong> If you are in danger or experiencing a mental health emergency, please contact emergency services (911) or a crisis hotline (988) immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Not a replacement for professional advice:</strong> Our AI provides general information, not personalized medical or mental health advice. Always consult licensed professionals for care decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Not staffed by healthcare professionals:</strong> Our website is an educational technology platform, not a medical or mental health practice.</li>
        <li><strong>Not able to make guarantees:</strong> We cannot promise that any particular service, platform, or approach will work for your individual situation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>About Our AI Technology</h2>
      <p>
        Our AI chat feature is powered by OpenAI's language model technology. The AI is configured to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Respond in a calm, supportive, and non-judgmental tone</li>
        <li>Provide general information about telehealth options</li>
        <li>Encourage users to seek professional help when appropriate</li>
        <li>Refuse to provide medical advice, diagnoses, or crisis intervention</li>
        <li>Direct users to emergency services when crisis situations are detected</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>AI Limitations:</strong> AI technology has inherent limitations. Responses may occasionally be incomplete, inaccurate, outdated, or not fully relevant to your situation. The AI does not have access to real-time information, cannot verify the current status of any service or platform, and cannot assess your individual circumstances. Always verify important information with qualified professionals before making decisions about your health or care.
