        We don't wait for a heart attack to care for our cardiovascular health—why wait for a crisis to care for mental health? Preventative mental health care focuses on building resilience, catching early warning signs, and maintaining wellbeing proactively. Telehealth makes this approach more accessible than ever.

      <h2>What Is Preventative Mental Health Care?</h2>
      <p>
        Preventative care involves actions taken to maintain mental wellness and reduce the likelihood of developing mental health problems. It includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary prevention:</strong> Promoting mental wellness in everyone (stress management, healthy coping skills)</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary prevention:</strong> Early identification and intervention for those at risk or showing early signs</li>
        <li><strong>Tertiary prevention:</strong> Preventing relapse or worsening in those who have experienced mental health conditions</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Why Invest in Prevention?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Better outcomes:</strong> Early intervention leads to faster, more complete recovery</li>
        <li><strong>Cost-effective:</strong> Prevention is less expensive than crisis treatment</li>
        <li><strong>Quality of life:</strong> Maintaining wellness feels better than recovering from illness</li>
        <li><strong>Functional impact:</strong> Avoid disruptions to work, relationships, and daily life</li>
        <li><strong>Breaking cycles:</strong> Prevent patterns from becoming entrenched</li>
        <li><strong>Ripple effects:</strong> Your mental health affects those around you</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Know Your Risk Factors</h2>
      <p>
        Awareness of risk factors allows for proactive care:
      </p>

      <h3>Personal History</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Previous mental health episodes</li>
        <li>Childhood adversity or trauma</li>
        <li>Chronic medical conditions</li>
        <li>Substance use history</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Family History</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder in family members</li>
        <li>Suicide in family</li>
        <li>Substance use disorders</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Current Circumstances</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Major life transitions or stressors</li>
        <li>Social isolation</li>
        <li>Financial or job insecurity</li>
        <li>Caregiving responsibilities</li>
        <li>Relationship difficulties</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Having risk factors doesn't mean you'll develop problems—but it does mean extra attention to prevention is wise.

      <h2>Special Considerations</h2>

      <h3>Previous Mental Health History</h3>
      <p>
        If you've experienced depression, anxiety, or other conditions, prevention is especially important. Work with a provider to develop a maintenance and relapse prevention plan.
      </p>

      <h3>High-Stress Periods</h3>
      <p>
        During major transitions or stressful times, consider increasing preventative activities or scheduling extra therapy sessions.
      </p>

      <h3>Family Planning</h3>
      <p>
        Those with risk factors should discuss prevention with providers before pregnancy or other major life changes.
