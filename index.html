      <p class="hero-text">
        Telehealth Navigator AI is built to make one thing easier: understanding your options for online help
        without feeling rushed, sold to, or judged. Instead of endlessly scrolling through ads and websites,
        you can talk with an AI guide that responds in clear, human-style language while you think through
        what might work for your life.
      </p>
      <p class="hero-text">
        Nothing here is medical or mental-health advice. The AI cannot diagnose, treat, prescribe, or respond
        to emergencies. It simply helps you organize your thoughts, learn about common telehealth paths, and
        then connect with real professionals or trusted services when you are ready.
      </p>
      <a href="chat.html" class="btn-primary hero-cta">Talk to the AI guide ↗</a>
      <p class="hero-note">
        When you open the chat, you can say “Hi”, describe what life looks or feels like, or ask questions
        about therapy types, psychiatry, online clinics, costs, privacy, and more. The AI will reply in a
        calm, supportive tone and can suggest next steps you might explore with real clinicians.

      <p>
        If you or someone else may be in immediate danger, experiencing thoughts of self-harm, or going through
        a medical or mental-health emergency, <strong>do not</strong> use this website or its AI chat.
        Instead, contact local emergency services, a crisis hotline, or a trusted in-person professional right away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crisis resources differ by country. Look up the emergency number or crisis hotline for your location,
        contact your doctor or local hospital, or reach out to someone you trust who can help you get urgent care.
