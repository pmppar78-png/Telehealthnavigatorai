        Online psychiatry services connect you with licensed psychiatrists or psychiatric nurse practitioners who can diagnose mental health conditions, prescribe medications, and provide ongoing medication management—all through telehealth platforms. This guide provides an overview of popular online psychiatry services to help you understand your options.

      <h2>Understanding Online Psychiatry</h2>
      <p>
        Online psychiatry differs from online therapy in important ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Psychiatrists</strong> are medical doctors (MDs or DOs) who can prescribe medication</li>
        <li><strong>Psychiatric nurse practitioners</strong> (PMHNPs) can also prescribe in most states</li>
        <li><strong>Focus</strong> is typically on diagnosis and medication management rather than talk therapy</li>
        <li><strong>Sessions</strong> are often shorter and less frequent than therapy sessions</li>
        <li><strong>Prescriptions</strong> can be sent directly to your pharmacy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many people benefit from combining psychiatry with talk therapy from a separate provider.
      </p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Overview of Online Psychiatry Services</h2>
