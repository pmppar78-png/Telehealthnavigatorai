      <p class="hero-text">
        Telehealth regulations vary significantly from state to state. This guide provides a general overview of key legal considerations, including provider licensing, insurance parity laws, and prescribing regulations. Understanding these differences can help you navigate telehealth options in your state.
      </p>
      <div class="legal-note">
        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> This guide provides general educational information only and is not comprehensive legal advice. Telehealth laws change frequently. Always consult current state regulations, your healthcare provider, or a qualified attorney for guidance on specific legal questions.

      <h2>Key Areas of State Telehealth Regulation</h2>
      <p>
        States regulate telehealth in several important areas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Provider Licensing:</strong> Where providers must be licensed to treat patients</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance Parity:</strong> Whether insurers must cover telehealth like in-person care</li>
        <li><strong>Prescribing Rules:</strong> Requirements for prescribing medications via telehealth</li>
        <li><strong>Informed Consent:</strong> What patients must be told before telehealth visits</li>
        <li><strong>Technology Standards:</strong> Requirements for telehealth platforms and security</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Standards:</strong> Standards of care for telehealth encounters</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Provider Licensing Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        The general rule across all states: healthcare providers must be licensed in the state where the patient is located at the time of the visit, not where the provider is located.
      </p>

      <h3>How This Affects You</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your therapist or doctor must hold a valid license in your state</li>
        <li>If you travel to another state, your provider may not be able to treat you there</li>
        <li>Some platforms automatically match you with properly licensed providers</li>
        <li>Always verify your provider is licensed in your state</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Interstate Licensing Compacts</h3>
      <p>
        Several professional compacts allow providers to practice across state lines more easily:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC):</strong> Covers physicians in 40+ states</li>
        <li><strong>Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC):</strong> Covers nurses in 40+ states</li>
        <li><strong>Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact (PSYPACT):</strong> Covers psychologists in 40+ states</li>
        <li><strong>Counseling Compact:</strong> Covers licensed professional counselors (growing membership)</li>
        <li><strong>Social Work Licensure Compact:</strong> Covers social workers (newer compact)</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Insurance Parity Laws</h2>
      <p>
        Insurance parity laws require health insurers to cover telehealth services similarly to in-person services. Coverage varies by state:
      </p>

      <h3>What Parity Laws Typically Require</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Coverage of telehealth services under the health plan</li>
        <li>Similar reimbursement rates for telehealth and in-person visits</li>
        <li>No additional restrictions on telehealth that don't apply to in-person care</li>
        <li>Coverage for services from the patient's home</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>General State Categories</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strong Parity States:</strong> Comprehensive laws requiring equal coverage and reimbursement</li>
        <li><strong>Moderate Parity States:</strong> Require coverage but may allow different reimbursement rates</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Parity States:</strong> Basic coverage requirements with more insurer flexibility</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Check with your insurance company for specific coverage details in your state.

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Prescribing Regulations</h2>
      <p>
        States have varying rules about prescribing medications through telehealth:
      </p>

      <h3>General Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Valid patient-provider relationship:</strong> Most states require establishing a relationship before prescribing</li>
        <li><strong>Video requirements:</strong> Some states require video visits for initial prescriptions</li>
        <li><strong>Controlled substances:</strong> Stricter rules typically apply (see below)</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Same medical record requirements as in-person visits</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Controlled Substance Prescribing</h3>
      <p>
        Federal law (Ryan Haight Act) and state laws govern telehealth prescribing of controlled substances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generally requires at least one in-person or video evaluation</li>
        <li>DEA registration may have specific telehealth requirements</li>
        <li>Some states have stricter requirements than federal law</li>
        <li>Pandemic-era flexibilities may have expired or become permanent depending on state</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Informed Consent Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Most states require specific informed consent for telehealth services. This typically includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explanation of telehealth and how it differs from in-person care</li>
        <li>Potential risks and benefits of telehealth</li>
        <li>Privacy and security measures in place</li>
        <li>The patient's right to refuse telehealth and request in-person care</li>
        <li>Technical requirements and troubleshooting procedures</li>
        <li>Emergency protocols and local resources</li>
      </ul>
